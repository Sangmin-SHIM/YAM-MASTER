# Yam Master

Yam Master is a strategic dice game where players aim to score points by placing their pieces on the game board, creating alignments, and blocking their opponent's pieces. The objective is to achieve the highest score or to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal alignment of five pieces.

## Description

Yam Master is an adaptation of the classic dice game Yam's. Players take turns rolling five dice and trying to achieve different combinations, which allow them to place their pieces on the game board. The game continues until one player runs out of pieces or achieves an alignment of five pieces, resulting in an instant victory.
